            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Faculty of Engineering, Computer Engineering Program, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) is an educational path that I am interested in because I am interested in studying and learning how to build and develop computer programs, including creating and developing various technologies to be modern and help facilitate daily life. I also dream of being a part of creating technologies that benefit the world. These interests are the force of my educational goals.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;While I was in junior high school, I started learning basic computer programming, which was the starting point that interested me, and I love learning to program. So I spent my free time to studying about programming, including studying the working principles of various programs found in daily life, such as studying the principles of creating websites, studying how to create applications, studying how to write codes to control the operation of Microbit boards and Arduino UNO boards, and studying and finding knowledge about various technologies from online learning sources. Later, when I started studying in senior high school, I learned about more interesting computer programming, which I was able to use to develop my knowledge into innovative projects that I was able to test and find that creative projects can help facilitate daily life.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;In the fields of Computer Engineering, I have a variety of knowledge and skills in learning and programming, including programming in Python and C++, which are the foundations for programming that can be further developed in my studies. I am confident that my knowledge, experience, and abilities will be the foundation that will enable me to succeed in my higher education.
            <br><br>
            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;If I am passed the selection process to study in the Faculty of Engineering, Computer Engineering Program, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT), I will use my knowledge and skills to study and develop research or projects to the best of my ability. And I will always seek new knowledge to challenge myself to continuously create works that benefit society.

            &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;The Faculty of Engineering, Computer Engineering Program, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi (KMUTT) is the path of study that I decided to study at the higher education level. I believe that studying in this field, faculty, and university will open up good opportunities both in terms of education and future careers for me. This is because KMUTT is a university that consists of faculty and personnel who have both experience and ability, which are the main factors in producing students who are quality graduates, along with having a curriculum and educational technology that are up-to-date.

                  Participated in and organized a volunteer activity “Share Happiness to Children Camp” at the Border Patrol Police School, Ban Na Yao. I acted as a lecturer to provide knowledge and advice to the students about important concepts and principles for learning to invent and develop science projects. I also organized recreational activities to make the students happy and funny while participating in the activities.
